** DONE Sequence Diagrams
*** TODO Goal
    Describe the different sequence diagrams that can occur for at least 
    three use cases.
*** DONE Content
    See: use_cases.org: I provide rudimentary sequence diagrams that use
    branching syntax with .s, this is visible in every use case's description.
    Minor modifications would be needed to convert these to various 
    sequence diagrams: specifically, editing them for each possible 
    branch.
